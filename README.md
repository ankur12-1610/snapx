## Aims to Accomplish

  ### Pain points users
  - Users do not receive any update when a transaction is made to their wallet.
  - Users don't receive any notifications about offers made on their NFT on OpenSea.
  - No updates regarding proposals being launched on registered
 DAO to users.
 - If users have lost their private key, they may struggle to recover their MetaMask account.
 - Private key is very sensitive hence we need to safely store it.
 - If users have forgotten their seed phrase, they may have trouble accessing their account.

 ### Our Solution
 - #### SnapX-Notify
    - Receive notification whenever a proposal is launched by any of the DAOs you follow.
    - Receive updates whenever someone send ether to their Metamask wallet.
    - Receive alerts when a buyer makes an offer on your published NFT on OpenSea.
 - #### SnapX-RecoveryKit
    - In case where the users lose their private key, we provide a method to recover the wallet via recovery key.
    - Since the recoveryKey is public (since it is encrypted) we can freely store it anywhere.
